  internal `leftJoin` operations for `SingleCellExperiment` method.

## AcidPlots 0.7.1 (2023-10-05)

Minor changes:

- `plotCountsCorrelation`: Add back `xName` and `yName` arguments, which
  are useful for customizing the plot labels.

## AcidPlots 0.7.0 (2023-10-04)

Major changes:

## AcidPlots 0.6.1 (2023-08-17)

Major changes:

- All custom ggplot2 functions are now prefixed with `acid_`, for consistency.
- Simplified `acid_coord_flip` as `acid_discrete_coord_flip`. This no longer
  attempts to parse the `gg` object, and returns `ggproto`, so it can be
  chained in `+` operations.
- Renamed scale functions to fit ggplot2 `snake_case` conventions:
  `autoContinuousColorScale` to `acid_scale_color_continuous`;
  `autoContinuousFillScale` to `acid_scale_fill_continuous`;
  `autoDiscreteColorScale` to `acid_scale_color_discrete`;
  `autoDiscreteFillScale` to `acid_scale_fill_discrete`.

Minor changes:

- Removed usage of BiocParallel.

## AcidPlots 0.6.0 (2023-08-11)

Major changes:

- Now requiring R 4.3 / Bioconductor 3.17.
- Reworked internal code to use rlang pronouns (`.data`) instead of legacy
  syntactic sugar approach with `!!` and `sym`. Refer to rlang documentation
  for details on non-standard evaluation and tidy evaluation.

Minor changes:

- Updated ggplot2 deprecations related to recommendation of `linewidth` instead
  of `size` for line geoms.
- `plotCountsPerCell`: Hardened `point` mode for SCE objects that don't contain
  precalculated `nCount` metadata in `colData`. Also improved error message
  when user attempts to plot `point` with a geom other than `ecdf`.
- `plotCorrelation`: Now using recommended `after_stat` instead of deprecated
  `stat` function for correlation calculations.

## AcidPlots 0.5.5 (2023-04-27)

- NAMESPACE fixes for Bioconductor 3.17 compatibility.
- Now classing on `DFrame` instead of `DataFrame` virtual class.

## AcidPlots 0.5.3 (2022-11-09)

Minor changes:

- Updated R dependency versions.
- Hardened internal calls to `facet_wrap` by using `vars` consistently.
  This requires calling `sym` with `!!` or `syms` with `!!!` (from rlang).

## AcidPlots 0.5.2 (2022-10-25)

Minor changes:

- Improved dependency pinning, in anticipation of breaking changes introduced
  in basejump package updates, notably pipette and AcidExperiment.

## AcidPlots 0.5.0 (2022-05-06)

Major changes:

- Starting a new release series that provides compatibility with R 4.2
  and Bioconductor 3.15.

Minor changes:

- Removed internal dependencies on tibble (e.g. `as_tibble` coercion).

## AcidPlots 0.4.0 (2022-03-11)

Major changes:

- Now using patchwork package internally for grid layout instead of cowplot.
- `plotUpset`: Now using ComplexUpset engine interanlly.

Minor changes:

- `matchLabels`: Simplified argument matching using new `argName` approach
  instead of legacy `choices` approach. Also improved hardening against
  mismatched user input, when attempting to specify elements in `labels` list
  that are not allowed/supported internally in the function.

## AcidPlots 0.3.9 (2021-08-09)

Minor changes:

- `matchLabels`: Now allowing input of `logical(1)`, so we can better support
  dynamic automatic plot labels.

## AcidPlots 0.3.8 (2021-07-27)

Minor changes:

- `acid_geom_label_repel`: Now setting `max.overlaps = Inf` internally, to
  ensure that all points are always labeled. Refer to ggrepel examples
  documentation for details on `max.overlaps` argument, and the override
  option `ggrepel.max.overlaps`, which works globally in an R session.

## AcidPlots 0.3.7 (2021-06-29)

Minor changes:

- Documentation improvements. In particular, split out documentation for our
  customized ggplot2 layer functions, which were previously documented
  (albeit in a somewhat confusing manner) in `geoms.Rd` file.
- Updated basejump and plotting dependency packages.
- Updated internal `guides()` handling to use character string instead of
  logical (e.g. `FALSE`), which was changed in ggplot 3.3.5+.

## AcidPlots 0.3.6 (2021-05-17)

Major changes:

- `plotCorrelation`: Updated `data.frame` method to support `labelCol`, which
  is useful for defining the column to use for plot labels.
- `plotCorrelation`: The `trans` now defaults to "log10", instead of "identity".
  This is recommended for IC50 plots, which are the intended use of this
  function the majority of the time.

Minor changes:

- Updated dependencies to latest versions available on conda.
- Removed RColorBrewer and matrixStats as dependencies.

## AcidPlots 0.3.5 (2021-03-12)

Minor changes:

- Removed unnecessary stringr dependency, since these functions are now
  reexported inside basejump.

## AcidPlots 0.3.4 (2021-03-02)

Minor changes:

- Ensure we reexport `percent` from scales, which is used in pointillism.

## AcidPlots 0.3.3 (2021-02-16)

Minor changes:

- Reexporting rlang functions that allow for standard evaluation within
  ggplot object creation: `!!`, `!!!`, `sym`, and `syms`.
- Removed need to use `Matrix::colSums` internally. Just inherit from the
  regular S4 generic.

## AcidPlots 0.3.2 (2021-02-10)

Minor changes:

- Including some reexports that are used in DESeqAnalysis: `draw_plot`,
  `ggdraw`, `log_breaks`, `plot_grid`, and `pretty_breaks`.

## AcidPlots 0.3.1 (2021-02-09)

New functions:

- `plotCorrelation`: Quick X-Y correlation scatterplot that calculates the R2
  value, similar to plots in GraphPad Prism.

Minor changes:

- `plotWaterfall`: Reworked internal code to better handle splitting out of
  interesting groups into separate plots.
- Added initial `SummarizedExperiment` method support to `plotWaterfall`.
- Bug fixes to avoid issues with hard-coding `sampleID` internally as sample
  identifier column, helping improve migrate to `sampleId` as preferred method.
- Package no longer attaches basejump.

## AcidPlots 0.3.0 (2020-10-07)

- Renamed package from acidplots to AcidPlots.

## acidplots 0.2.36 (2020-09-02)

Minor changes:

- `plotCounts`: Added an assert to check for user attempting to use bar geom
  with `style = "wide"`. Also added `sort` argument, which allows the user
  to easily plot the genes alphabetically instead of by vector order.

## acidplots 0.2.35 (2020-09-01)

Minor changes:

- `plotCounts`: Added `geom` argument to support additional visualization types
  other than dots. Can now plot boxplot, violin, or bar plot.

## acidplots 0.2.34 (2020-08-25)

Minor changes:

- `plotHeatmap`: Improved internal factor and NA handling of pheatmap annotation
  metadata, which can otherwise cause some legends to not render correctly.
  Note that we're ensuring factors get releveled correctly here.

## acidplots 0.2.33 (2020-08-25)

Major changes:

- `plotUpset`: reworked default formals to now include `nIntersects` and
  `orderBySize` arguments. Improved internal argument handling and assert
  checks, ensuring user is passing in an integer matrix containing only 0,1
  values. Improved the data.frame method to drop non-0,1 columns automatically,
  which supports the UpSetR movies working example.
- `plotPCA`: Reworked `subtitle` and `title` formals to instead use the
  standardized `labels` approach instead. Now automatically plots the number
  of genes used, which defaults to the top 500 most variable.

Minor changes:

- Updated default `color` and `fill` arguments to inherit better from ggplot2
  defaults: `scale_colour_continuous` and `scale_colour_discrete`. The defaults
  still inherit from `acid.color.continuous` and `acid.color.discrete` first but
  then fall back to the ggplot2 default global options
  `ggplot2.continuous.colour` and `ggplot2.discrete.colour`.

## acidplots 0.2.32 (2020-08-05)

Minor changes:

- Now using cli package for improved message appearance.

## acidplots 0.2.31 (2020-08-05)

Minor changes:

- `plotUpset`: Adjusted ratio of dot matrix to main barplot, to handle complex
  multiple comparisons better.

## acidplots 0.2.30 (2020-07-23)

Minor changes:

- Updated minimum R dependency to 4.0.
- `plotUpset`: Added matrix and list method support. Simplified internal code,
  reducing dependencies from UpSetR. Maybe consider switching to ggupset in a
  future update.

## acidplots 0.2.29 (2020-07-09)

Minor changes:

- `plotWaterfall`: Now supports log transformations, defaulting to log10.
  Labels are disabled by default, and now only supported for non-log plots.
  For log transformed data, a line is now shown at the y intercept.

## acidplots 0.2.28 (2020-06-25)

New functions:

- `plotWaterfall`: Easily plot concentration curve (e.g. IC50) waterfall
  plots.

## acidplots 0.2.27 (2020-06-10)

Minor changes:

- `matchLabels` now returns an empty list for a `NULL` argument. This approach
  is used in the upcoming pointillism update, in the `plotStackedBarPlot`
  function.

## acidplots 0.2.26 (2020-04-21)

Minor changes:

- `plotCounts`, `plotHeatmap`, `plotQuantileHeatmap`: Added
  `convertGenesToSymbols` support to override automatic mapping of genes to
  symbols, which is enabled by default.
- `plotHeatmap`, `plotQuantileHeatmap`: Improved `showRownames` handling for
  automatic visualization of rows, which are now enabled by default for heatmaps
  with <= 50 features.

## acidplots 0.2.25 (2020-04-13)

Minor changes:

- Updated documentation and roxygen dependency to v7.1.0.
- Updated ggplot2 and other graphical R package dependencies.
- Fixed `plotHeatmap` unit tests to harden against `SummarizedExperiment` and
  `SingleCellExperiment` objects defined in AcidTest package that contain
  rows and/or columns with all zeros. Refer to `nonzeroRowsAndCols` function
  in basejump for details.
- Rebuilt pkgdown website using v1.5 update.

## acidplots 0.2.24 (2020-03-11)

Minor changes:

- `acid_coord_flip`: Fix for breaking change introduced by ggplot2 v3.3.0,
  which renamed `object[["layers"]][[1L]][["geom"]][["required_aes"]]` from
  `"x"` to `"x|y"`. The package now requires this new version of ggplot2.

## acidplots 0.2.23 (2020-02-22)

Minor changes:

- Changed license from MIT to GPL-3.
- Updated internal code to use `aggregateCellsToSamples` instead of
  `pseudobulk`, which has migrated to pointillism and will be reworked in an
  upcoming release.
- Updated documentation for `SingleCellExperiment` methods, where
  `aggregateCellsToSamples` is called internally. This was propagating to other
  packages where `SingleCellExperiment` methods are not defined, making the
  documentation confusing.

## acidplots 0.2.22 (2020-01-20)

Minor changes:

- Updated bioverbs dependency to renamed AcidGenerics package.

## acidplots 0.2.21 (2019-12-13)

Minor changes:

- `plotHeatmap`: Increased the default break range from `-2:2` up to `-3:3`.
  This helps improve the dynamic range a bit for some RNA-seq plots.

## acidplots 0.2.20 (2019-12-09)

Minor changes:

- Hardened user-defined `interestingGroups` input against `NA` values causing
  values to drop in plots. This was discovered with `plotPCA` calling
  `geom_point` internally, which caused removal of rows. If we coerce `NA` value
  to `"NA"` first, then removal no longer occurs. This is accomplished
  internally using `str_remove_na` (see also `stringi_remove_na`). The change
  applies to these functions: `plotCellCounts`, `plotCounts`,
  `plotCountsPerBiotype`, `plotCountsPerBroadClass`, `plotCountsPerFeature`,
  `plotFeaturesDetected`, `plotPCA`, `plotTotalCounts`, `plotZerosVsDepth`.

## acidplots 0.2.19 (2019-11-19)

Minor changes:

- `plotCounts`: The `gene` argument is now optional, supporting subset
  `SummarizedExperiment` objects. Currently a maximum of 20 genes (rows) are
  allowed to pass through in the method.
- Updated documentation to support roxygen2 7.0 release.
- Improved default color palettes for `plotHeatmap`, `plotCorrelationHeatmap`,
  and `plotQuantileHeatmap`.

## acidplots 0.2.18 (2019-11-12)

Minor changes:

- `plotCounts`: Reworked `medianLine` argument and renamed to simply `line`.
  Now supports mean and geometric mean in addition to median now.
  Line is now disabled by default.

## acidplots 0.2.17 (2019-11-07)

Minor changes:

- Updated dependencies to require Bioconductor 3.10 release.
- Added return value for `matchLabels` in documentation.

## acidplots 0.2.16 (2019-09-17)

Major changes:

- Replaced `title` argument with `labels` argument for functions that render
  plots using ggplot2.
- Now exporting `matchLabels` function, that handles internal ggplot2 label
  matching, and auto-populates with defaults in formal argument.
- Using "samplesAxis" and "countsAxis" labels for ggplot2 return that support
  multiple geoms. Consider a similar approach for QC metric plots.

Minor changes:

- Simplified internal handoff from `SingleCellExperiment` S4 methods to
  `SummarizedExperiment`, using standard `...` passthrough instead of relying
  upon `matchArgsToDoCall`.
- Improved color palette consistency in plotting functions.
- `plotCounts`: Moved `DESeqDataSet` method to DESeqAnalysis package.

## acidplots 0.2.15 (2019-09-13)

Major changes:

- `acid_theme_dracula`: New dark mode theme supporting Dracula color palette.
- Exporting color palette vectors: `lightPalette`, `darkPalette`,
  `draculaPalette`, `iOSLightPalette`, `iOSDarkPalette`, `macOSLightPalette`,
  `macOSDarkPalette`.
- `synesthesia`: Simplified color palette to use purple, blue, green, orange.
  User can tweak the palette using a new `palette` argument.

## acidplots 0.2.14 (2019-08-27)

Minor changes:

- `plotCountsPerFeature`: Renamed formals to match conventions in new basejump
  `melt` methods.
- Updated basejump dependencies and NAMESPACE.
- Tightened up if/then checks, ensuring boolean flag return.
- Improved some working examples and unit tests.

## acidplots 0.2.13 (2019-08-21)

Minor changes:

- `plotPCA`: Improved automatic `ntop` argument handling when passing in a
  value greater than the number or features (rows) defined in the object.
- Improved documentation for `SingleCellExperiment` methods that need to average
  or aggregate expression at sample level.
- Removed dplyr and magrittr dependencies.

## acidplots 0.2.12 (2019-08-20)

Minor changes:

- Improved consistency of internal tibble handling inside plot functions.
- Updated basejump dependency versions.

## acidplots 0.2.11 (2019-08-12)

Major changes:

- Migrated some QC plotting functions previously defined in bcbioSingleCell
  package. This makes it possible to share the code for new Chromium package,
  designed for importing single cell RNA-seq data from 10X Genomics.

## acidplots 0.2.10 (2019-08-06)

Minor changes:

- Improved documentation consistency by importing shared parameter roxygen
  from the new AcidRoxygen package.
- Updated basejump dependency versions.

## acidplots 0.2.9 (2019-07-30)

- Updated some unit tests to reflect RangedSummarizedExperiment example update
  in AcidTest package.

## acidplots 0.2.8 (2019-07-29)

Minor changes:

- Improved warning suppression for partial match in `pheatmap` calls.
- Improved documentation.
- Improving automatic plot title and label handling with new `makeLabel` and
  `makeTitle` functions from syntactic update.

## acidplots 0.2.7 (2019-07-23)

New functions:

- `plotCountsCorrelation` and `plotCountsCorrelationHeatmap`: New functions
  optimized for plotting correlation between gene expression matrices.
  Particularly useful for comparing pseudoaligned vs. aligned counts, which is
  implemented in the new bcbioRNASeq package update.

Minor changes:

- Improved naming consistency of internal S4 functions.
- Updated basejump dependencies.

## acidplots 0.2.6 (2019-07-18)

Minor changes:

- `plotCountsPerBiotype`: Internal tidyeval bug fix for call to `dplyr::top_n`.
  Previously, the `n` argument supported direct variable input, but now it
  must be unquoted, due to change in underlying rlang engine following the
  0.4 update.

## acidplots 0.2.5 (2019-07-17)

Minor changes:

- `upset`: Compatibility update for UpSetR v1.4 release.
- Compatibility fixes for basejump v0.10.11 release.

## acidplots 0.2.4 (2019-05-08)

Minor changes:

- Improved log2 and log10 axis scale handling for `plotCountsPerBiotype` and
  `plotCountsPerBroadClass`. Previously, the `breaks` argument was defined in
  internal `scale_y_continuous` ggplot2 call, but this doesn't perform well for
  many RNA-seq datasets at log2 scale. Instead, it's better to log2 scale the
  data first and then simplify indicate log2 on the y axis title.
- `plotCountsPerFeature`: Improved custom color handling for density geom.
  Removed violin geom support but added jitter geom support. The violin
  plot method doesn't scale well for multiple samples, and the boxplot is
  visually easier to interpret for this metric, in general.

## acidplots 0.2.3 (2019-05-05)

Major changes:

- Now pinned against R >= 3.5.

## acidplots 0.2.2 (2019-04-26)

Major changes:

- Now importing `upset` function from UpSetR, with modified formals, so we can
  easily call this from other packages, including [DESeqAnalysis][].

## acidplots 0.2.1 (2019-04-25)

New functions:

- New `gradient` palette functions: `purpleOrange`, `blueYellow`.
- Remove gplots package from imports.

Major changes:

- `plotHeatmap` now supports automatic color calculation when `breaks` argument
  is defined. Also improved support for `legendBreaks`.

Minor changes:

- Fix `.pheatmapColorPalette` internal check for `color`, which requires `n`
  argument, rather than assuming positional variable.
- `plotCountsPerFeature`: Improve the count subtitle.
- S4 generic reexport documentation fixes.
- Miscellaneous documentation fixes.

## acidplots 0.2.0 (2019-04-22)

Reworked package, consolidating previous minimalism and firestarter packages.

New functions:

- `synesthesia` color palette functions.
- `acid_coord_flip`: Intelligently puts samples at the top of the Y axis when
  flipped. Particularly useful for barplots.
- `acid_pretty_breaks`: Attempt to improve `scales::pretty_breaks`, using an
  approach more similar to the base plot engine.
- Renamed ggplot2 themes: `acid_theme_light`, `acid_theme_dark`.

Major changes:

- All ggplot2 geoms and transformations (`ggproto` functions) now consistently
  use `acid_` as a prefix.

Minor changes:

- `plotCountsPerBiotype` and `plotCountsPerBroadClass` now support `title`.

Deprecations:

- `plotCountsPerGene` has been renamed to `plotCountsPerFeature`.
- `plotGenesDetected` has been renamed to `plotFeaturesDetected`.
- Deprecated `theme_paperwhite` and `theme_midnight` in favor of
  `acid_theme_light` and `acid_theme_dark`.

## acidplots 0.1.2 (2019-04-18)

New functions:

- `base_breaks`: An attempt as automatic pretty breaks based on the default R
  plotting engine. Derived from a Stack Overflow post (see documentation).

Minor changes:

- `plotCountsPerBiotype`, `plotCountsPerBroadClass` switched to recommending
  log10 counts by default.

## acidplots 0.1.1 (2019-04-15)

Updated packages depencies and switched to Docker for Travis CI.

## acidplots 0.1.0 (2019-03-28)

Initial release, migrating ggplot2 functions from [basejump][] package.
